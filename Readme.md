#Project Proposal 
A web-application that provides context for the people listed currently in the New York Public Library Database in the Billy Rose Theater Collection. 

##Use Case
For any researcher, student who finds a picture in the current collection, the images are labeled with the person's name, but also no other identifying information is possible.

Currrently, you can view a picture like this one: 
[http://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/707ded43-45bd-be59-e040-e00a18066cf0](http://)

But there is no information about this person. 
#####Who was she? What plays or films did she make?

A quick google search shows her Broadway Database Page:
[http://ibdb.com/person.php?id=15075
](http://)

And her Broadway World Credits:
[http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Terese-Hayden/](http://)

And her IMDB Page:
[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4067275/](http://)


##Solution
Using the NYPL API, the Wikimedia API, the IMDB api, I propose to create a website that would allow a user to have a greater context for an actor. This information would be nicely formatted, and would provide more context to the photo of the production.

The website will be hosted for free and will be open-access.
